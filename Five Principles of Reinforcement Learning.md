# Five Principles of Reinforcement Learning:
1. The input and output system
2. The reward
3. The AI environment
4. The Markov decision process

### The input and output system
Every single form of AI, including Machine Learning models, ChatBots, recommender systems, robots, will take something as input, and will return another thing as output.

In Reinforcement Learning, input is called state or input state. The output is the action performed by the AI. And in the middle, we have a function that takes a state as input and return an action as output. That function is called a policy.
